**This SDK is compatible with Appwrite server version 1.8.x. For older versions, please check [previous releases](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-go/releases).**

Appwrite is an open-source backend as a service server that abstract and simplify complex and repetitive development tasks behind a very simple to use REST API. Appwrite aims to help you develop your apps faster and in a more secure way. Use the Go SDK to integrate your app with the Appwrite server to easily start interacting with all of Appwrite backend APIs and tools. For full API documentation and tutorials go to [https://appwrite.io/docs](https://appwrite.io/docs)

## Installation

Initialize your go module if you haven't already:

```bash
go mod init <YOUR_MODULE_NAME>
```

To install using `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-go
```

## Testing the SDK

* Clone this repo.
* Create a project and within this project a collection.
* Configure the documents in the collection to have a attribute `key` = `hello`.
* Then inject these environment variables:

  ```bash
  export YOUR_ENDPOINT=https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1
  export YOUR_PROJECT_ID=616a09..0180
  export YOUR_KEY=7055781..cd95
  export DATABASE_ID=616a09..0180
  export COLLECTION_ID=616a09..20180
  ```

* Create `main.go` file with:

	```go
	package main

	import (
		"log"
		"os"
		"time"

		"github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-go/appwrite"
		"github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-go/id"
	)

	func main() {
		client := appwrite.NewClient(
			appwrite.WithEndpoint(os.Getenv("YOUR_ENDPOINT")),
			appwrite.WithProject(os.Getenv("YOUR_PROJECT_ID")),
			appwrite.WithKey(os.Getenv("YOUR_KEY")),
		)

		databases := appwrite.NewDatabases(client)

		data := map[string]interface{}{
			"hello": "world",
		}
		doc, err := databases.CreateDocument(
			os.Getenv("DATABASE_ID"),
			os.Getenv("COLLECTION_ID"),
			id.Unique(),
			data,
		)
		if err != nil {
			log.Printf("Error creating document: %v", err)
		}

		log.Printf("Created document: %v", doc)
	}
	```

* After that, run the following

  ```bash
  go run main.go
  ```

* You should see the following output:

  ```bash
  2021/10/16 03:41:17 Created document: map[$collection:616a095b20180 $id:616a2dbd4df16 $permissions:map[read:[] write:[]] hello:world]
  ```
